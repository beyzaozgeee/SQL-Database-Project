### SQL Database Project

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts I created while practicing relational database design, data manipulation, and query operations.  
The project includes:

- Database schema creation (tables, keys, constraints)
- Insert, Update, Delete operations
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- JOIN operations (INNER, FULL JOIN)
- Subqueries
- Stored procedures
- String and math functions
- Example queries based on a simple student & product management system

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my foundational SQL skills and my ability to work with structured data and relational database systems.
